## eyecons
A work-in-progress collection of 16x16 icons

### Usage
All the icons can be found in the [`icons/`](./icons)

* [`icons/uncolored/`](./icons/uncolored) - for use in websites. Just copy and paste the contents of an SVG file anywhere in your HTML document. These icons will use the same color as their parent element.
* [`icons/html/`](./icons/html) - the same as `icons/uncolored/`, but with the `.html` extension, and the root `<svg>` having an `eyecons` class.
* [`icons/black/`](./icons/black) and [`icons/white/`](./icons/white) - for use anywhere else. These icons are normal SVG images.

### TODO
* Icon previews/examples for the readme
* Rewrite the icon addition script in a good programming language
* Write contributing guidelines
