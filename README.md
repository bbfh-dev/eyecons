# Eyecons

A 16x16 (scallable vector graphics) icon pack that prioritizes consistency and quality over quantity.

- **Optimized for the web** — It uses `currentColor` (`color` property in CSS) instead of black/white allowing for adaptability.
- **Handcrafted files** — I take care of manually modifying the icon file to be nice & optimized.

Icons in `beta/` are designs that need more work before they look right.
